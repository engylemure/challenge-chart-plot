# Plotting a Chart (https://engylemure.github.io/challenge-chart-plot)
 
React + (Rust â™¥ WebAssembly)

## Introduction

Considering that I was studying Rust for possible use in backend development given its
good performance and security I considered that to solve this challenge it could be
possible to develop my knowledge regarding it. Some points have developed a great
interest in developing a rust module for event processing.
Among them the easy use of the web code compiled through web assembly, the best 
processing performance and low memory cost.

### React Libraries Choice

During the development of the components I identified some libraries that could 
be used for text editing and graphic plotting and ended up opting 
for the ones that best met my needs being [Material-Ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core)
for easy use of responsive and stylish components according to Material Design, 
[Monaco Editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monaco-editor/react#editor) for 
editing text, [react-chartjs-2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2) 
for dynamic and responsive graphics generation (A react wrapper from the well-known 
[chart.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chart.js) library).
